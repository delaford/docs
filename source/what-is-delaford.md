Delaford is an online, open-source JavaScript medieval-themed RPG open for everyone to collaborate on or just poke around for offline fun.

Taking influence from dungeon crawlers and games like RuneScape and Ultima Online, Delaford hopes to provide the nostaligic feeling of being eaten by the grue in today's modern world.

You can roam the world, level up your skills, and see how JavaScript, Classes and Vue Components all shape up that make this game.

Delaford is completely open-source but that doesn't mean you can't play the game online on the official game server. Feel free to fork the game and submit your own features, or help bug fixes. 

At the end of the day, Delaford exists to serve as a foundational basis of a traditional JavaScript RPG in the land of `<canvas>` and Web Sockets.

## Technology

The technology that makes up Delaford is two-fold, although you can technically play it without one of the folds. The first fold is the API and Database. The API and Database serve as a way to save player data and load it up using Laravel and PHP.

The other part is JavaScript with some help of Web Sockets for server/client interaction and Vue.js as the UI library.

You do not have to download the `website` repository to be able to play the `game`. You will be able to pre-load a player so you can quickly start checking it out.
